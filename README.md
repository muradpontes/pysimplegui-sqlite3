# pysimplegui-sqlite3

Trying to code a login app with register using a database.

I'm using PySimpleGUI and SQLite3 together to build an login app with a database.
PySimpleGUI to create a graphic interface and SQLite3 to keep saved in a database the accounts registered in the app.
It's my first time using libraries in my programs, let's see what happens.
